## JS + CSS Clock

This is the second thing I made following the (30 Day Vanilla JS Coding Challenge)[https://javascript30.com/]. This course is duly, highly recommended! The promise of the course is to build 30 different tiny projects, with the following characteristics:

No Frameworks
No Compilers
No Libraries
No Boilerplate

## Todos

- Improve the CSS and JS
- Add a background that changes colour taking the current time as a hex value.
